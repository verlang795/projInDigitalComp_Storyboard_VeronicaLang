# Project Reflection

Welcome to our Project Reflection metacognition tool, powered by Stasis Theory. You'll make a really cool web document that helps you process your learning experience. Through the process, you'll learn a little bit about coding while you strategically package the work you have accomplished in your project/internship/teaching assistantship.  

## Get Started


1. Find the green "Code" button at the top of this repository [Project Reflection Repository](https://github.com/Pitt-Fuego/project-reflection)

2. Click "Code" then "Download ZIP" to your local computer. 

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Move this folder to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. For Mac, Windows, and Linux, download and/or open a code editor like [atom.io](https://atom.io) or any code editor of your choice. If you use a Chromebook O.S., we recommend Caret. 

5. Use the code editor to open the index.html and style.css documents from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text! 

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes." 

8. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" in the left hand menu. Change the source setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save"

9. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

10. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
